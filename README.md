# Code-Quiz

In this challenge, I made a Dynamic website using Javascript DOM Manipulation and Event Listeners. This website hosts a Coding Quiz with questions regarding HTML and CSS. The questions and answers are all created by Javascript and the final score/time as well as highscores are stored via Local Storage.

The deployed application can be found at: [abhibiju.github.io/Code-Quiz](https://abhibiju.github.io/Code-Quiz)

Here is what the website currently looks like:
